CONTEXT7 INTEGRATION
--------------------
Library: /aio-libs/aiohttp
Topic: asyncio concurrency event loops coroutines tasks futures async patterns
Tokens: 8000

Context7 snippets integrated:
- WebSocket handling with parallel event sources
- ClientSession lifecycle management
- Event loop creation and management
- Background task patterns

- Testing utilities and patterns

KEY FEATURES COVERED
--------------------
Core Concepts:
- Event loops and loop policies
- Coroutines vs functions
- Tasks and futures
- Async context managers
- Synchronization primitives

Concurrency Patterns:
- Gather (concurrent execution)
- Wait (flexible waiting)
- Semaphore (limit concurrency)
- Lock (mutual exclusion)
- Event (signaling)
- Queue (producer/consumer)

Task Management:
- Creating and naming tasks
- Task cancellation
- Exception handling
- Timeout handling

Event Loop Management:
- Loop policies
- Running blocking code
- Loop callbacks
- Custom executors

Performance Optimization:
- Profiling async code
- Optimizing concurrency
- Avoiding common pitfalls
- Resource management

Common Pitfalls:
- Creating ClientSession outside event loop
- Session as class variable
- Forgetting await
- Blocking the event loop
- Not handling cancellation
- Deadlocks with locks

Production Patterns:
- Graceful shutdown
- Background tasks with application lifecycle
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker
- WebSocket with multiple event sources
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting

Best Practices:
- Testing async code
- Debugging techniques
- Documentation standards
- Error handling
- Resource cleanup
